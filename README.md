# BASE-Z47 [Sokoban in Rust] (Console and Web Assembly Versions)

This is a simple **console-based Sokoban game** written in Rust. It is my first Rust project, created as a learning exercise after completing the third chapter of "The Rust Programming Language" book.

## Why This Project?

At the end of Chapter 3 in *The Rust Programming Language*, the authors encourage readers to stop and try writing some Rust code before moving forward. This project is my attempt to apply what I've learned so far.
